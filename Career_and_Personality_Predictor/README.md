### Overview  
The **Career & Learning Path Predictor** is an intelligent agent built using **Jaseci** and powered by **Gemini 2.0 Flash**, a cutting-edge large language model.  
It analyzes a user‚Äôs **skills, interests, and personality** to recommend fitting career paths and tailored learning directions.  

This project highlights how **AI-driven reasoning** and **semantic modeling** can be applied to real-world decision support ‚Äî from career guidance to personal growth.

## Features  

**Profile Modeling** ‚Äì Captures a person‚Äôs background, skills, and personality traits.  
**Career Suggestion** ‚Äì Suggests suitable career paths aligned with the user‚Äôs abilities.  
**Learning Path Generator** ‚Äì Recommends next steps such as courses, tools, or technologies to learn.  
**LLM Integration** ‚Äì Uses `byllm` with the **Gemini 2.0 Flash** model for intelligent reasoning.  
**Single-File Simplicity** ‚Äì Entire logic is contained in one `.jac` file (`predictor.jac`).

## How It Works  

1. **Profile Creation**  
   The `Profile` object defines a user‚Äôs background and context:
   ```jac
   obj Profile {
       has name: str;
       has age: int;
       has interests: list[str];
       has skills: list[str];
       has personality_type: list[str];
   }
   ```

2. **Career Prediction**  
   ```jac
   def suggest_career(profile: Profile) -> list[str] by llm();
   ```
   Uses Gemini to propose the most suitable career options based on the profile.

3. **Learning Path Recommendation**  
   ```jac
   def learning_path(profile: Profile, chosen_career: str) -> str by llm();
   ```
   Suggests a personalized roadmap ‚Äî what skills, tools, or courses to pursue next.

4. **Walker Execution**  
   A test walker runs the process by:
   - Creating a demo user (e.g., *Nelly Mogere, 22, AI & Cybersecurity enthusiast*).  
   - Asking the model for career suggestions.  
   - Printing the top career and an AI-generated learning path.
